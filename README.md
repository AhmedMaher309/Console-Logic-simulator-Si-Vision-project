# Si-Vision-project/Logic simulator
 
### How to use
1. write the gate following by the two input nodes and the output node (example: AND A B C)
2. After entring all the connections write the nodes setup (example: SET A 0)
3. Any unsetted node will be zero by default
4. Write SIM to start simulation
5. Write OUT ALL to view all nodes values or OUT (gate name) to view the gate
